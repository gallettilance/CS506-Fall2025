# Notes on Decision Trees & Ensemble Methods - Vishnuram Ayyavu Vijayakumar

A collection of notes, practice problems, and Python implementations focusing on Decision Trees, Random Forests, and the Bias-Variance Tradeoff.

## Contents
### Theory (Slides): 
Notes on Decision Trees, Bagging, Boosting, and Model Evaluation (Bias vs. Variance).

### Practice Questions: 
Problems covering region splits in R2, calculating Information Gain, and visualizing high-bias/high-variance models.

### Implementation:
From-scratch implementation of a simple Decision Tree and Random Forest classifier applied to a real-world dataset.
